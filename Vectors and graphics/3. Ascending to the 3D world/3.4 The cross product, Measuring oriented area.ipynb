    "As previously introduced, the cross product takes two 3D vectors u and v as inputs, and its output u Ã— v is another 3D vector. It is similar to the dot product in that the lengths and relative directions of the input vectors determine the output, but is different in that the output has not only a magnitude but also a direction."
